# Household Energy Consumption Prediction Model

## Project Summary
The objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts the energy consumption of household appliances based on various input features. By leveraging data on temperature, humidity, time of day, and appliance power readings, the model aims to provide insights into energy usage patterns and facilitate energy efficiency improvements in residential settings.
